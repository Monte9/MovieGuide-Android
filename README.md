# MovieGuide Android App

## Motivation

This past summer, I developed a simple To Do list app for Android. Coming from a iOS background it was relatively easy to pick up and I was able build a working To Do list app although with eye-bleeding UI and probably not adopting best practise for Android development.

As I have previously working with iOS and React Native, I decided to learn Android in order to complete the Trilogy of Mobile Development and give me an all-round persective on app development across different platforms.

Hence, I enrolled in the CSC 780: Mobile Development with Android class to fulfil my CS elective requirement at SF State in Fall' 16.
